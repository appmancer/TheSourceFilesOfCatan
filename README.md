# The Source Files of Catan
SVG files to create Settlers of Catan tiles, specifically for the XPlotter.

These files are based on the tiles created by GlowForge at https://glowforge.com/pdfs/game-board.pdf

The source files here, like the originals, are licenced under Creative Commons Attribution 4.o International licence.

I've made significant changes to the designs to make them suitable for the XPlotter.  I've also used images from openclipart.com
